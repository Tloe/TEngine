                                                         
in file Source/cmVisualStudio10TargetGenerator.cxx
can't remember which part of it is added and which is original, look at the source around line 434
probably the GetProperty("PLATFORM_TOOLSET") is that modified part
then set_target_properties(target PROPERTIES PLATFORM_TOOLSET "v120_CTP_Nov2012")
it works well, I have all 3 projects in a solution compiled as v120_ctp and i can rebuild whole solution with cmake and it sets the
correct toolset
i converted too many parts of my code to c++11 goodies and there was no step back so I had to hack that thing in cmake or go crazy
having to set it manually every time I rebuild solution ;) 


   if(this->Target->GetProperty("PLATFORM_TOOLSET"))
      {
      this->WriteString(((std::string)"<PlatformToolset>" + this->Target->GetProperty("PLATFORM_TOOLSET") + "</PlatformToolset>").c_str(), 2);
      }
     else if(const char* toolset = gg->GetPlatformToolset())
      {
      std::string pts = "<PlatformToolset>";
      pts += toolset;
      pts += "</PlatformToolset>\n";
      this->WriteString(pts.c_str(), 2);
      }
